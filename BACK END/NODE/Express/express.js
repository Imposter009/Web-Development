>>What is Postman?
Postman is an app that is used to collect all the get and post requests through a custom URL sent by the user. It minimizes our work by not allowing us to write JavaScript in the Node application. We can also skip fetching all the APIs with the help of Postman.

>> what is api::
API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

>>Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. Simply, it creates custom backends automatically for us as per our requirements. For example we learned to create custom backends for different pages like about us, contact us and services and serve between them using if-else-if. But express creates the servers for these pages automatically for us.Moreover, it handles all the routings for us and also simplifies all the process in the web development for us
