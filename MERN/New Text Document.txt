React
:Not quite possible to build a full feature rich application ready to be deployed for production
:React is a library for building user interfaces
:You have to make decisions on other features of the app like routing, styling, authentication etc,
:client side rendering of UI element
:need to add routing and other packages
:Js takes control over everything in browser(hence Client side)


Next.js
:A package that uses React for building user interfaces
:Loaded with a lot more features that enable you to build full fledged production ready applications.
Features exactly like routing, styling, authentication, bundle optimization etc.
:There's no need to install additional packages. Next.js provides everything for you
Opinions and conventions need to be followed to implement the above said features
:Server side rendering of UI elements
:helps in SEO
:many packages are already installed
:contains html css and js in browser(hence server side)
